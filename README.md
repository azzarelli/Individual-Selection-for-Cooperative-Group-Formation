# Individual-Selection-for-Cooperative-Group-Formation
COMP6202: Individual Selection for Cooperative Group Formation reproduction and extension of 
*Individual Selection for Cooperative Group Formatiom*, Powers, S. T., Penn, A. S. and Watson, R. A. (2007).

## Brief
We explore social cooperation vs selfish action over constraints of individual selection. Whereby individuals in some population are responsible for
their own selection criteria, hence selection for cooperation (if achieved) comes naturally rather than induced by external selection pressures. This
allows us to simulate organism population with similar characterists through the use of a Genetic Algorithm.

The extension of Powers (2007) proposes a distributional structure to the phenotypes denoting individual preference from group size. Previously,
individuals could choose between joining large/small groups for reproduction. Building upon this, we present the issues relating to realistic intepretation of this
scenario and try to replicate the original results (i.e. cooperation can thrive and be finally selected for in a pool of random individuals). In doing so, 
individuals were capable of selecting for cooperation under a varying set group sizes as a result of distributional preference, i.e. individuals who previously prefered
"small groups" we able to select for group size 2-6 (for large groups this range was 35-45).
